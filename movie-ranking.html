<p value="3">Mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher Walter White thinks his life<br />
   can't get much worse. His salary barely makes ends meet, a situation not<br />
   likely to improve once his pregnant wife gives birth, and their teenage son<br />
   is battling cerebral palsy. But Walter is dumbstruck when he learns he has<br />
   terminal cancer. Realizing that his illness probably will ruin his family<br />
   financially, Walter makes a desperate bid to earn as much money as he can<br />
   in the time he has left by turning an old RV into a meth lab on wheels.</p>
