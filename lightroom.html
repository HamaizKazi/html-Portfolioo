<h1>Hamaiz's Color Graded Pictures</h1>
<h2>These Are Three Pictures I Captured And Color-Graded</h2>
<hr />
<h3>What do I mean by Color-Grade?</h3>
<p>When trying to capture a certain scene, as essential as it is to be aware of:
<ul>
<li>The lighting</li>
<li>The Subject</li>
<li>The Background</li>
<li>The Angle</li>
<li>The Composition</li>
<li>The Camera Settings</li>
<li>The Lense</li>
</ul>  
<br /> 
you can, quite literally, change the entire look
and feel of the photo in post.<br /> 
By enhancing and de-enhancing the exposure and colors of a photo
you can<br />
achieve a certain look you have in mind
from a movie or a Tv Show</p>

<p>I will show you 3 photos, and what they look like before versus after the edit.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Before And After.</h3>
<ol>
<li><h4>Before:</h4>
<img src="./assets/images/buttonunedit.JPG" alt="A glowy red shut-down button on a mirror (un-edited)" width="500" height="320">
<h4>After:</h4>
<img src="./assets/images/Shut-Down.jpg" alt="A glowy red shut-down button on a mirror (edited) width="500" height="320"" >
</li>
<li><h4>Before:</h4>
<img src="./assets/images/isnkunedit.JPG" alt="A photo of a clean kitchen (un-edited)" width="500" height="320">
<h4>After:</h4>
<img src="./assets/images/Cinematic-Kinda.jpg" alt="A photo of a clean kitchen (edited)" width="500" height="320">
</li>
<li><h4>Before:</h4>
<img src="./assets/images/bulbunedit.JPG" alt="A photo of a vintage-edison bulb with small leaves in the background (unedited)" width="500" height="320">
<h4>After:</h4>
<img src="./assets/images/Plont-Bolb.jpg" alt="A photo of a vintage-edison bulb with small leaves in the background (edited)" width="500" height="320">
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Now, my goal was to demonstrate how you can
 change the look of a photo in post<br />
and also to
prove a point that the edited ones look better
than the original ones.<br />
For example, in the 3rd photo, 
the bulb looks cleaner and more transparent!<br />
How amazing is that ?!</p>

<p>I edited each one in around 25 minutes without actually studying color-grading.<br />
hence, it is totally possible that one might find flaws in these.
It is also possible<br />
that some of you might prefer the unedited version slightly more
(especially in<br />
 the case of the first two images), which is totally fine.
Always remember that<br />
this is a field where personal preference plays a huge part
and that is why it is<br />
important to try and find fun in the process!.
